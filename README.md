# Avalon
Camera xBee-Arduino wireless transceiver that communicates with a xBee-Arduino wireless gateway interfaced by USB-Serial to a Processing GUI to control camera snapshots and image transmission.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Hardware
*2 x Arduino UNO (https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
*2 x Arduino Wireless SD Shield - RETIRED (https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-wirelss-sd-shield)
*2 x xBee S2C (Datasheet: https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/pdfs/90002002.pdf)
*1 x 3 wire CMOS Camera Module - 728x488 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11745)
*2 x 9V battery connector
*Jumper Wire
*1 x USB Cable

#### Software

*Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
*XCTU (https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/xctu-software/xctu)
*Processing IDE (https://processing.org/download/)

### Building



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) - The Arduino IDE used to program Arduino UNO
* [xBee](https://www.digi.com/) - Wireless Transceiver 
* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - Used to create GUI
